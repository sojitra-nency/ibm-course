# Practice Repository

Welcome to my practice repository! This repository was created while I was taking a course on Coursera to practice my coding skills and learn new concepts. It serves as a exercise that I worked on during the course.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to the instructors and course creators on Coursera for providing such a valuable learning experience.
